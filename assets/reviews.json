We experienced a nearly 5-hour delay due to an accident on the Transfăgărășan, and Dragos was extremely understanding and accommodating. The treehouse itself is charming and unique. However, there are a few things worth noting for future guests. The bed is quite narrow for two people, and unfortunately, we didn’t sleep very well. Also, the toilet and shower are located within the same space as the kitchen, just 2–3 meters from the bed, which may not be ideal for everyone. Lastly, we’re a bit particular about lighting, and the setup didn’t quite suit our taste. The treehouse features only indirect lighting — either stark white or very yellow — which didn’t create the most comfortable atmosphere for us. Overall, it’s a cute place, but with a few considerations depending on your preferences."

We also had their two mountain dogs and two cats visit us often, which was a plus for us, since we love animals. The dogs are VERY nice and extremely friendly (just a reminder). Just fluffy-carebears. I highly recommend this location to anyone."

      "Anamaria Luciana 4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 , · Stayed a few nights We stayed there for 2 nights and it was wonderful, not only the area, but also the AirBnB itself. A great location, quiet and private! Good directions. We had daily visits from the animals living there, just super sweet and very friendly to humans. The hosts, or the grandparents, were very friendly and helpful and made good suggestions for sightseeing in the area. If you needed something, they could help you out right away. Overall a great experience, I can only recommend it and will definitely come again!! Translated from German Show original",
      "Elena 10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 , · Stayed a few nights We thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Our highlight was the 2 cats and 2 dogs that liked to be petted. Everything was as described and a beautiful place to be in nature. Note: There is no door to the toilet, you should know, but it did not bother us. Translated from German Show original",

Translated from French Show original",
      "Olivia 11 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · July 2025 , · Stayed a few nights Communication with Dragos was excellent, and check-in went very smoothly. We experienced a nearly 5-hour delay due to an accident on the Transfăgărășan, and Dragos was extremely understanding and accommodating. The treehouse itself is charming and unique. However, there are a few things worth noting for future guests. The bed is quite narrow for two people, and unfortunately, we didn’t sleep very well. Also, the toilet and shower are located within the same space as the kitchen, just 2–3 meters from the bed, which may not be ideal for everyone. Lastly, we’re a bit particular about lighting, and the setup didn’t quite suit our taste. The treehouse features only indirect lighting — either stark white or very yellow — which didn’t create the most comfortable atmosphere for us. Overall, it’s a cute place, but with a few considerations depending on your preferences.",

The hosts were extremely nice and helpful and responded to all our needs. But one should know to expect a full “small house in the tree” experience:).",

The owner even told us when we arrived that the bed might be a bit smaller for the both of us, but we could sleep amazingly well, with actually enough room to spare in that bed. I am pretty \"solid\" at 1.89cm height, and my 17 y/o son is tall as well and \"well-built\". The host, his wife, and their parents as well were such amazing people. We also had their two mountain dogs and two cats visit us often, which was a plus for us, since we love animals. The dogs are VERY nice and extremely friendly (just a reminder). Just fluffy-carebears. I highly recommend this location to anyone.",

We stayed here during some beautiful winter days with lots of snow and it was like a straight out of a fairytale. The interior of the house was made with a great taste and with comfort in mind, we had everything we needed. To have their dogs always welcoming and visiting us was amazing and it recharged us with their energy and they also have 2 beautiful cats. Dragoș and Mădălina,they are amazing, one day after a heavy snow we find our alley to the house swept clean of snow and it was really nice of them to do that.

A few minutes by car to Bram Castle. There's a Kaufland along the way, so you can shop. Great neighborhood and friendly owner pets. Cottage well-maintained, everything is working. owner friendly, communicative. They speak English, respond to messages, always helpful. The only downside is the lack of a microwave. The rest is ok. Definitely a place to rest outside the city and as a stopover on the way. I recommend and best regards! Translated from Polish Show original",

The resident cats were a cute bonus too! We did have a problem with the shower not draining but host fixed that the same day. There were also 2 beagles in the house next door that were CONSTANTLY barking! Really spoilt the quiet, peacefulness the stay was supposed to be, considering there was even a sign saying no music as it’s meant to be peaceful. Messaged the host about this but they never replied on this."

Wonderful views of the surrounding mountains that are spectacular. There is a wonderful trout restaurant nearby (turn right onto the paved road when leaving the unpaved access road.

      "Tom 8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 , · Stayed a few nights Such a quirky stay in a great location for visiting Bran Castle. Very comfortable, clean and cosy. We went in colder months and it was very warm inside which was lovely. The resident cats were a cute bonus too! We did have a problem with the shower not draining but host fixed that the same day. There were also 2 beagles in the house next door that were CONSTANTLY barking! Really spoilt the quiet, peacefulness the stay was supposed to be, considering there was even a sign saying no music as it’s meant to be peaceful. Messaged the host about this but they never replied on this.",
      "Beatriz 1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 , · Stayed a few nights ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We absolutely loved our stay at the Guitar House! 🎸 The place is super clean, cozy, and comfortable everything was perfect. The hosts are incredibly kind and welcoming; they even helped us find a local guide who took us on an amazing hike! We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. It truly felt like home, and we’d love to come back one day.",

The small(ish) interior is very creatively designed and imaginatively laid out. There are neighbours either side of the property but the outside areas (decking at front door and shelter in the garden) were enjoyable places to hang out and enjoy the quiet. Wonderful views of the surrounding mountains that are spectacular. There is a wonderful trout restaurant nearby (turn right onto the paved road when leaving the unpaved access road. Perfect place to stay for a few nights before driving to Bucharest to fly home. Thanks Drago!",
