The dogs were the sweetest companions—friendly, gentle, and full of charm. Evenings were magical, with an atmosphere that felt calm, cozy, and absolutely delightful. While the space is a touch smaller than it appears in the photos and the internet can be a bit slow at times, these were only minor details in an otherwise wonderful experience. We left with full hearts and happy memories, and we can’t wait to return!"

        "message": "Communication with Dragos was excellent, and check-in went very smoothly. We experienced a nearly 5-hour delay due to an accident on the Transfăgărășan, and Dragos was extremely understanding and accommodating. The treehouse itself is charming and unique. However, there are a few things worth noting for future guests. The bed is quite narrow for two people, and unfortunately, we didn’t sleep very well. Also, the toilet and shower are located within the same space as the kitchen, just 2–3 meters from the bed, which may not be ideal for everyone. Lastly, we’re a bit particular about lighting, and the setup didn’t quite suit our taste. The treehouse features only indirect lighting — either stark white or very yellow — which didn’t create the most comfortable atmosphere for us. Overall, it’s a cute place, but with a few considerations depending on your preferences."

The hosts were extremely nice and helpful and responded to all our needs. But one should know to expect a full “small house in the tree” experience:)."

We also had their two mountain dogs and two cats visit us often, which was a plus for us, since we love animals. The dogs are VERY nice and extremely friendly (just a reminder). Just fluffy-carebears. I highly recommend this location to anyone."

You enter through the hosts' front yard, walk above a cute bridge above a pond with ducks, and get to your 'tree house' all the way in the back. The tree house has an amazing view, a nice terrace with a table and a bench, and inside there is a super comfy bed, a fire place, small kitchen, toilet, shower, fridge, extra blanket, extra trash bags/toilet paper/soap/dishes, still water, and –wait for it–floor heating! Everything is super clean and tidy. At night, it's quiet and you see the stars. The air is fresh. There's plenty of hiking routes and things to do around if you like nature. But I gotta stress — the hosts vere EXTREMELY kind and genuine people. Definitely worth it!!!"

The rest of the services of the house is correct, although the toilet and the kitchen do not have physical separation, not even a curtain, which can be uncomfortable, and unhygienic."

From the moment we arrived, the host’s warmth and kindness made us feel instantly at home. The dogs were the sweetest companions—friendly, gentle, and full of charm. Evenings were magical, with an atmosphere that felt calm, cozy, and absolutely delightful. While the space is a touch smaller than it appears in the photos and the internet can be a bit slow at times, these were only minor details in an otherwise wonderful experience. We left with full hearts and happy memories, and we can’t wait to return!",

      "Olivia 11 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · July 2025 , · Stayed a few nights Communication with Dragos was excellent, and check-in went very smoothly. We experienced a nearly 5-hour delay due to an accident on the Transfăgărășan, and Dragos was extremely understanding and accommodating. The treehouse itself is charming and unique. However, there are a few things worth noting for future guests. The bed is quite narrow for two people, and unfortunately, we didn’t sleep very well. Also, the toilet and shower are located within the same space as the kitchen, just 2–3 meters from the bed, which may not be ideal for everyone. Lastly, we’re a bit particular about lighting, and the setup didn’t quite suit our taste. The treehouse features only indirect lighting — either stark white or very yellow — which didn’t create the most comfortable atmosphere for us. Overall, it’s a cute place, but with a few considerations depending on your preferences.",

      "Arina 9 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · January 2025 , · Stayed a few nights The place is really nice and the surrounding area is very beautiful.

The hosts were extremely nice and helpful and responded to all our needs. But one should know to expect a full “small house in the tree” experience:).",

      "Gianluca 3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · September 2024 , · Stayed a few nights Small but comfortable cabin, very hot at night thanks to the radiant floor, the bed is peculiar because of the shape but can sleep 2 people perfectly the environment is fantastic and very well cared for, the pets are very nice, totally recommended Translated from Spanish Show original",
      "Wilna 2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · September 2024 , · Stayed a few nights It was a great stay where you can relax. You will be greeted every morning by all the animals that walk around, especially the dogs. Definitely worth it! Translated from Dutch Show original",
      "Luchian 4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2024 , · Stayed a few nights We had an unforgettable experience at \"Peace and Heaven\"! The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful - a perfect place to unplug and relax. We were impressed by the tranquility and beauty of the surrounding nature. We were surrounded by animals, which added a special charm to our stay. The host was very kind and welcoming, making us feel at home. She gave us all the necessary information and was always available for any question or need. We will definitely come back to see Cora 😊 We recommend this little house to anyone who wants a quiet and relaxing escape. Translated from Romanian Show original",

      "Razvan 3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2023 , · Stayed a few nights Very friendly host,always responsive and a great & clean location with lots of activities to do.",
      "Iulia 4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2023 , · Stayed a few nights I fully recommend this place. Not only did it look better than the pictures, but the hosts were incredibly kind, responsive, welcoming, and helpful. The place is super easy to get to. You arrive and the host welcomes you with a tour. You have plenty of space to park your car. You enter through the hosts' front yard, walk above a cute bridge above a pond with ducks, and get to your 'tree house' all the way in the back. The tree house has an amazing view, a nice terrace with a table and a bench, and inside there is a super comfy bed, a fire place, small kitchen, toilet, shower, fridge, extra blanket, extra trash bags/toilet paper/soap/dishes, still water, and –wait for it–floor heating! Everything is super clean and tidy. At night, it's quiet and you see the stars. The air is fresh. There's plenty of hiking routes and things to do around if you like nature. But I gotta stress — the hosts vere EXTREMELY kind and genuine people. Definitely worth it!!!",
      "Rafael 9 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · March 2024 , · Stayed a few nights The house is located inside the plot where the owners also live, and there are other houses for rent. The views are amazing, and the surroundings are beautiful. The house is small, as described, although the description indicates that the bed \"has foam mattress, it is customized, and it is not a standard double bed\", the reality is that the width of the foam mattress is not enough for two adults to rest comfortably, which caused the second night to have a contracture on the back that conditioned the rest of my trip. The rest of the services of the house is correct, although the toilet and the kitchen do not have physical separation, not even a curtain, which can be uncomfortable, and unhygienic. Translated from Spanish Show original",
      "Zvezdana Alina 1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2024 , · Stayed a few nights I highly recommend it. The area is gorgeous and quiet. Very friendly hosts. Everything was really nice. Translated from Romanian Show original"

The host was very kind and gave very good recommendations for hiking around the area. What a treat - will definitely return in the winter season."

The floors were squeaky, the pillars were half rotten, I can go on and on… Oh… I forgot, I burned myself on the toilet, if you are over 60kgs, you will not fit on the toilet without getting burned. there is a pipe next to the wc that’s connected to the heating and you have to poop sideways so you don’t get burned. There is no light at the bbq area, we had to use our phones to light up. Let’s say, compared to the amazing photos taken, the house is poorly made, and kinda uncomfortable for 4 people. The host was nice, the dogs were amazing even tho they stole our food at night. I never left a bad review on this app, but I feel this one is necessary. Response from Dragos November 2023 At the moment you parked the car, even before seeing the house your group started with a very bad attitude, that the location is not as you expected (without doing a little bit of research on the location and surroundings) I even offered to give a full refund if you wish not to stay to our place. We didn't hear any complains from you during the stay. Feedback such as rotten pillars are unfortunately untrue. Those pillars (which are nost structural pillars, are recovered from an old house, they are not rotten, but aged, and they were intentionally placed there to give a particular feeling. Also burning on the toilet is a bad joke. That pipe is designed to heat the toilet space and it goes maximum to 60 degree (the heat is electronically controlled), nobody (not even families with small kids) ever had any issue with it in hundred of stays that we had. Also you wanted a place in the woods but are surprised when you left the food outside over night that it disappeared. There are foxes in the woods, other small mammals, cats, and also our dogs. Also if there was problems with the light we could have replaced them in minutes if you would have mention it. It is important to note that you have only bad reviews on Airbnb also and we somehow expected problems. Usuals people are saying that the place is much more better than in the photos because the photos are made by us as amateurs with just our phones. This was indeed our lowest review since 4 years on Airbnb but fortunately our Airbnb are enjoining the experience, are understanding what we offer when they book a place and they don't come arguing even from the moment they parked the car. So I am sure you can go on and on with bad reviews because this was your attitude from the moment your group came.. We are note a hotel, we are an experience accommodation, a family business and the place was build to bring you closer to the nature, give you a special feeling which we are glad that we can provide to most of our quests who come to us open minded."

      "Schiller 5 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · November 2023 , · Stayed a few nights The electricity was unstable, the lights were blinking all the time, it was hurting our eyes, also we were afraid to charge our laptops. The floors were squeaky, the pillars were half rotten, I can go on and on… Oh… I forgot, I burned myself on the toilet, if you are over 60kgs, you will not fit on the toilet without getting burned. there is a pipe next to the wc that’s connected to the heating and you have to poop sideways so you don’t get burned. There is no light at the bbq area, we had to use our phones to light up. Let’s say, compared to the amazing photos taken, the house is poorly made, and kinda uncomfortable for 4 people. The host was nice, the dogs were amazing even tho they stole our food at night. I never left a bad review on this app, but I feel this one is necessary. Response from Dragos November 2023 At the moment you parked the car, even before seeing the house your group started with a very bad attitude, that the location is not as you expected (without doing a little bit of research on the location and surroundings) I even offered to give a full refund if you wish not to stay to our place. We didn't hear any complains from you during the stay. Feedback such as rotten pillars are unfortunately untrue. Those pillars (which are nost structural pillars, are recovered from an old house, they are not rotten, but aged, and they were intentionally placed there to give a particular feeling. Also burning on the toilet is a bad joke. That pipe is designed to heat the toilet space and it goes maximum to 60 degree (the heat is electronically controlled), nobody (not even families with small kids) ever had any issue with it in hundred of stays that we had. Also you wanted a place in the woods but are surprised when you left the food outside over night that it disappeared. There are foxes in the woods, other small mammals, cats, and also our dogs. Also if there was problems with the light we could have replaced them in minutes if you would have mention it. It is important to note that you have only bad reviews on Airbnb also and we somehow expected problems. Usuals people are saying that the place is much more better than in the photos because the photos are made by us as amateurs with just our phones. This was indeed our lowest review since 4 years on Airbnb but fortunately our Airbnb are enjoining the experience, are understanding what we offer when they book a place and they don't come arguing even from the moment they parked the car. So I am sure you can go on and on with bad reviews because this was your attitude from the moment your group came.. We are note a hotel, we are an experience accommodation, a family business and the place was build to bring you closer to the nature, give you a special feeling which we are glad that we can provide to most of our quests who come to us open minded.

Good supermarket about 10 minutes away. Both beds are elevated up a small set of stairs and mattresses are on the floor. This may be a concern if you have mobility issues. I found the beds to be quite firm. The outdoor space is wonderful. As other reviewers mentioned, it is not standalone property with privacy. This property is on a residential street with other rentals and full time residents near by. Neighbors have dogs who serve as excellent guard dogs and cats that visit the property frequently. Overall, this was a memorable stay. I’d recommended it for anyone as an alternate to camping!"

From there you have a great view of the surrounding mountains. The house is at the end of a road, and there are farmhouses and other vacation homes in the neighborhood. We were particularly pleased about the visit of the neighbor's cats, which came as soon as we sat outside and are very trusting. The house itself is exactly as described in the pictures, very original. The communication with the host and the check-in were super uncomplicated. A great stay!",

      "Heather Madeira, Ohio Rating, 5 stars , · June 2024 , · Stayed with kids Such a unique place! Everything was as described. A few notes for those that may help when finding the right pace for them. We did prepare a meal using the stove and outdoor grill. There are plenty of plates and cookery available for a party of 4 (or more!). Small fridge made it easy for breakfast and lunch prep. Good supermarket about 10 minutes away. Both beds are elevated up a small set of stairs and mattresses are on the floor. This may be a concern if you have mobility issues. I found the beds to be quite firm. The outdoor space is wonderful. As other reviewers mentioned, it is not standalone property with privacy. This property is on a residential street with other rentals and full time residents near by. Neighbors have dogs who serve as excellent guard dogs and cats that visit the property frequently. Overall, this was a memorable stay. I’d recommended it for anyone as an alternate to camping!",
      "Rauta 8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · February 2025 , · Stayed a few nights Accommodation was great. We were 2 adults 2 children 4 and 7 years old and a baby 7 months old. Even though the place wasn't huge it was all you need for us. We had everything we needed to cook as fans of cooking at home, the girls even had a few books and a small box with toys and for the little one there was plenty of room to walk beforehand what was beyond our expectations. The fairytale landscape and in the vicinity you found everything you wanted from the supermarket, restaurants to the activity and many beautiful places to visit. The host immediately answered any question and helped us with everything we needed. We will come back again. Translated from Romanian Show original",
